This repository showcases a rather uncommon bug in HTML related to using `innerHTML` to modify an existing element's content while introducing another element with the same ID.  The bug arises from improper DOM manipulation with `innerHTML`. The solution demonstrates the correct way to achieve the desired outcome by using DOM methods such as `createElement` and `appendChild`, avoiding potential ID conflicts and ensuring predictable behavior.
